# Model Card for EntityT5
 
# Model Details
 
## Model Description
 
T5+Trie to predict entities of the last sentence in a dialogue.
 
- **Developed by:** Jaren Yang
- **Shared by [Optional]:** Jaren Yang
- **Model type:** Text2text Generation 
- **Language(s) (NLP):** More information needed
- **License:** More information needed 
- **Parent Model:** T5
- **Resources for more information:** More information needed 
 	


# Uses
 

## Direct Use
This model can be used for the task of text2text generation 
 
## Downstream Use [Optional]
 
More information needed.
 
## Out-of-Scope Use
 
The model should not be used to intentionally create hostile or alienating environments for people. 
 
# Bias, Risks, and Limitations
 
 
Significant research has explored bias and fairness issues with language models (see, e.g., [Sheng et al. (2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.330.pdf) and [Bender et al. (2021)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922)). Predictions generated by the model may include disturbing and harmful stereotypes across protected classes; identity characteristics; and sensitive, social, and occupational groups.



## Recommendations
 
 
Users (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model. More information needed for further recommendations.

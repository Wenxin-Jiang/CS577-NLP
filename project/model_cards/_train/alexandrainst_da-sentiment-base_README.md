# Model Card for Danish BERT
 Danish BERT Tone for sentiment polarity detection
 
 
 
# Model Details
 
## Model Description
 
The BERT Tone model detects sentiment polarity (positive, neutral or negative) in Danish texts. It has been finetuned on the pretrained Danish BERT model by BotXO.
 
- **Developed by:** DaNLP
- **Shared by [Optional]:** Hugging Face
- **Model type:** Text Classification
- **Language(s) (NLP):** Danish (da)
- **License:** cc-by-sa-4.0
- **Related Models:** More information needed
  - **Parent Model:** BERT
- **Resources for more information:** 
  - [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/certainlyio/nordic_bert)

# Uses
 
## Direct Use
 
This model can be used for text classification
 
 
## Downstream Use [Optional]
 
 
More information needed.
 
 
## Out-of-Scope Use
 
The model should not be used to intentionally create hostile or alienating environments for people. 
 
# Bias, Risks, and Limitations
 
 
Significant research has explored bias and fairness issues with language models (see, e.g., [Sheng et al. (2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.330.pdf) and [Bender et al. (2021)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922)). Predictions generated by the model may include disturbing and harmful stereotypes across protected classes; identity characteristics; and sensitive, social, and occupational groups.
 
 
## Recommendations
 
 
Users (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model. More information needed for further recommendations.
